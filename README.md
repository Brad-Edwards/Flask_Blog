Flask with Python3 tutorial by Abdelhadi Dyouri hosted at Digital Ocean. Copyright Digital Ocean or the author. None of this is my own code. Many thanks to Digital Ocean and Abdelhadi.

Purpose:

This was a quick tutorial to wake my brain up to Python again. I have not done much in Python so wanted something to simple to prime myself for what I have studied before.

Observations:

1. Yes, Python is faster to type than my usual C# :)

2. I have done a couple of school projects in Blazor, and I find that getting used to templating and data-binding in one language makes it pretty straightforward in another. The difference is syntax and framework quirks.

3. I really need to learn Python project architecture. I kept thinking about what it would be like to make a full application in Python. In C# I understand MVC, modularity, DI, etc. I have no idea how these work in Python yet, so I have a lot to learn.

4. I can see how easy it would be to get stuck in one language or framework. There is a lot of upfront investment in getting used to something, then getting to the point where more time is spent expressing intent than looking things up. It is definitely tempting to carry on with what is known rather than go through that onboarding process all over.

5. Editors make a difference. This tutorial was the first time I had ever used Emacs. And I have to say, even with the time spent looking up commands I think I covered more ground, more quickly in Emacs than in Visual Studio 2019. I love VS, but the lag when I am type is noticeable. Whereas in Emacs, typing is at speed and opening and closing files is super fast. There is just less overhead.
